### Control Panel

You want to start your project or you want to manage your projects. You do that from the Control Panel:

[![Control Panel 2](/assets/images/mods/owners2.png)](/assets/images/mods/owners2.png)

You can see your projects and the projects you are involved in (as a collaborator) as well as any pending project invitations sent to you.


#### Start a Project

If you wish to start a project, you must click New Project to expand the project options.

[![Start Project](/assets/images/mods/owners3.png)](/assets/images/mods/owners3.png)

All fields are required, so you will need to fill them all. You are also asked to upload a ZIP of your project's files.

The build is considered a 'development' build so you will need to request for it to be changed to 'stable' at a later point.

#### Manage Projects

On this page you can see a list of all projects you are involved in and the projects you own.

If you want to manage the invitations you sent to other users or the invitations that were sent to you, this is where you can do that.
You can also send invitations from this page.

### Viewing a Project

As the owner of a project, this is what a project of yours will look like when you view its page:

On the right side of the page you can find the links to the pages where you can manage your project's details, collaborators, previews, translations and more importantly, builds.

#### Edit Project

This is where you can edit all your project's details (actually you can edit more here than you can enter when creating the project).

As you can see, there are many options for you configure.

#### Manage Collaborators

If you wish to invite someone to help you out with the project; Or if you want to remove someone from your collaborators list, you came to the right place.
