## Extend Site Documentation - Downloaders

[Main Page](https://community.mybb.com/mods.php)

As a user you're simply looking to download something: a plugin, a theme, an icon set, perhaps a language pack or just some other resource that you may find interesting.

For that reason, you can quickly navigate from the menu to one of the 4 main categories:

- Plugins

- Themes

- Transalations

- Graphics

Each main category has sub-categories, each with filtering options.


### Browsing a category

[![Browsing and Filtering](/assets/images/mods/downloaders1.png)](/assets/images/mods/downloaders1.png)

Clicking Download will quickly allows you to download the latest **stable** build and view how many times the project has been recommended.

Clicking the project names directs you towards the project page, on which you can see detailed information: full description, previews, license, suggestions, bugs, etc.

You can also filter searches based on what the community and developers have voted/done recently.

### Viewing a Project

When you visit a project page, here's how it looks like:

[![Project Page](/assets/images/mods/downloaders2.png)](/assets/images/mods/downloaders2.png)

You can expand and collapse the Information, Previews and License sections to view/hide their content.

On the right side, you can see the following options:

- Download (download page)

- License (expands the license section)

- Change Logs (page where the changes for each build are displayed)

- Report (where you can report a project)

- Star (allows you to recommend projects)

- Support (either the support link entered by the project author or a link to the support forum on the MyBB Community)

- Bug Tracker (you will see this option if it's been enabled by the project author)

- Suggestions (you will see this option if it's been enabled by the project author)

- Translations (translations posted by collaborators or the project owner)


If the owner of the project set a PayPal e-mail for donations, you will see a Donate button on the right as well.


#### Download

You can view the changes made in this build by extending the Changes section. Before downloading, you must accept the license by ticking the checkbox.


#### Bug Tracker

This page is only available to downloaders if the project owner set it like that (by default it's turned off for everyone).

From here you can post bugs that you found, search for others and reply to them.
