# MyBB 1.8.0

MyBB 1.8.0 was the first release in the MyBB 1.8 series. It was released on September 1, 2014. Many feature updates, performance improvements, security improvements, and antispam features were added in the release.

The 1.8 series was born to act as a bridge between the MyBB 1.6 series and MyBB 2.0, which would be a total rewrite of the software and take time. For this reason, the MyBB Team wanted to give the community something in between to give them modest updates while 2.0 would take longer to develop.

The 1.8 series development also marked the time when MyBB development moved away from the archaic RedMine ticketing system to GitHub, to allow for more community contributions and open development.

Some major features of this release can be found below. The [1.8 Release Blog Post](https://blog.mybb.com/2014/09/01/mybb-1-8-released/) has a more complete list.
