<p>MyBB 1.2.1.0 was released on 1 December 2007.
</p>

<p>MyBB 1.2.10 is now available on the MyBB website and is a general maintenance release. MyBB 1.2.10 will be the last maintenance release of the MyBB 1.2 series before MyBB 1.4.
</p><p>This release fixes numerous issues with versions released since 1.2.8 with some causing incorrect functionality of MyBB. These bugs have been fixed to provide a more stable version of MyBB for public use.
</p>

<p>The following two features were pulled out of MyBB 1.4 and back-ported to 1.2.10:
</p>
<ul><li> During an installation of MyBB, you can now choose the database collation/character set that should be used. The MyBB Group recommends users choose UTF-8, especially if you're using multiple languages on your forum.
</li><li> Users without a UTF-8 database can choose to convert their existing database via the Admin CP.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
MyBB 1.2.10 was also released to run with our upcoming public release of the MyBB Merge System, due for release shortly.
