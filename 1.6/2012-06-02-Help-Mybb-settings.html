<p>Settings are stored in two places, firstly in the database and secondly they are cached in ./inc/settings.php which is where the forum reads its settings from during its regular operation. If you find your settings are not being saved when you change them in your ACP then MyBB is most likely having problems updating this file. There are a few things you should try.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Check_settings.php_permissions">Check settings.php permissions</span></h2>
<p>MyBB needs to have permission to write to the ./inc/settings.php file so make sure this file is set to CHMOD 664 or 666 (Unix systems) or has read/write permissions (Windows).
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Regenerate_settings.php_file">Regenerate settings.php file</span></h2>
<p>If MyBB detects that ./inc/settings.php does not exist it will automatically regenerate this file based on the values stored in the database. If you are having problems with your settings it is safe to try deleting this file so MyBB can generate a fresh copy.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Determine_if_changes_are_actually_being_recorded_in_the_settings.php">Determine if changes are actually being recorded in the settings.php</span></h2>
<p>If you have changed a setting but it is not reflected on your board it is a worthwhile debugging technique to make a setting change then view the source of your ./inc/settings.php file to see if the new value is written there. It is useful to post the outcome of this test in your support thread if you make one.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="mod_security_problems">mod_security problems</span></h2>
<p>Sometimes the mod_security module in apache can cause the settings ACP page to return a HTTP error when saving which prevents the setting changes from being properly recorded. Read <a href="Help:Mod_security" title="Help:Mod security"> mod_security</a> for more information on dealing with mod_security problems.
