<p>Follow this procedure if you want to change the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://community.mybb.com/images/logo.gif">logo</a> at the top-left of your board.
</p>
<ol><li> Upload your logo to your webserver.
</li><li> Go to <b>Admin CP --&gt; Themes --&gt; Modify / Delete --&gt; Edit your Theme</b>
</li><li> Change the <b>Forum Logo</b> path to your new logo.
</li></ol>

<p>Alternatively, you can replace the original images/logo.gif with your own logo (but your logo must be in .gif).  However, this method may not work with custom themes.
