<p>The MyBB Team use <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.redmine.org">Redmine</a> for tracking issues and features for the software. It's very powerful once you get to know how to use it and this part of the wiki will run you through the basics.

<p>There are some general terms used around the tracker which might be confusing. They are explained below.
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>Commit</b> <br />A commit is an alteration of MyBB's coding. They can alter just a single line of code or replace entire files and are made by the developers to the repository. Normally, a commit will come with a message advising what it has fixed (the <i>commit message</i>).
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <b>Milestone</b> <br />A milestone is any version of MyBB both past and present. They are normally mentioned when talking about Roadmaps or targeting an issue to a future version of the software. For example, 1.4.5, 1.6.2 and 1.6.8 are all milestones of MyBB.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <b>Repository</b> <br />The MyBB repository holds all of the source code for the software. We use GitHub to host this repository. A common phrase would be <i>I've committed the changes to GitHub</i> - meaning changes have been made to the source code in the repository.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <b>Revision</b> <br />When a developer makes a commit, they also make a revision - it is information about what changes the developer's commit has made to the source code. A revision can also be called a <i>changeset</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <b>Issue Types</b> <br />Issues may have different statuses throughout their time on the tracker. Below are the different statuses we can assign to an issue.
<dl><dd> <br /><b>Closed</b> - an issue that has been fixed by a developer and verified by SQA <br /><b>Confirmed</b> - an issue that has been confirmed as being a valid within MyBB by the SQA/MyBB Team <br /><b>Deferred</b> - an issue that is either too difficult to fix or will not be fixed in the 1.x series <br /><b>New</b> - an issue that has been reported but yet to be confirmed by the SQA/MyBB Team <br /><b>Open</b> - generally used when discussing a list of issues, these are issues that have not yet been closed, rejected or deferred <br /><b>Rejected</b> - an issue that does not exist in MyBB, something that will not be fixed or something that works as it is intended <br /><b>Resolved</b> - an issue that has been fixed by a developer and awaiting verification that the fix actually works by the SQA/MyBB Team
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>

<p>Throughout the tracker, there are two important shortcuts we can use when describing or linking to revisions and issues. You can use these in many places, including descriptions of issues, comments and commit messages.
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>#0000</b> <br />By placing a hash tag before an issue number, the tracker will automatically pick up on it and provide a link to it. For example, if you wanted to link to issue number 1487, you would write <i>#1487</i>. Further examples: <i>#147</i>, <i>#3</i>.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <b>r0000</b> <br />If we're wanting to link to a specific revision that a developer has created, we can use the <i>r</i> prefix before the revision number. For example, <i>r5415</i>, <i>r4471</i>, <i>r134</i>.
</dd></dl>

<p>At the top of every page in the tracker is a search box. Not rocket science, but from here you can search through the entire history of MyBB issues from the past few years using keywords. If you want to set more options, such as whether to search for issues or changesets, just click on the 'Search' text before the search box itself.
</p><p>You can also quickly jump to certain issues from here - for example, typing <i>1541</i> into the search box will take you to issue #1501.
