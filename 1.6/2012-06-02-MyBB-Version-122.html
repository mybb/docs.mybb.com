<p>MyBB 1.2.2 was released on 1 December 2006, and is the last release in 2006.  This release fixes various reported bugs and low- to medium-risk security vulnerabilities.
</p>

<p>MyBB 1.2.2 has been released and is now available on the MyBB site for download. 1.2.2 is a general maintenance release as well as a security update release which patches two new low-medium threat vulnerabilities discovered in MyBB 1.2.x and 1.1.x.
</p><p>This release also corrects/adds the following:
</p>
<ul><li> Inline error messages for users changing their username, password or email address through the User CP
</li><li> Updated MySQL 5.1 strict compatibility
</li><li> PHP 5.2.0 shutdown bug
</li><li> Fixes for a whole range of other 1.2.1 and earlier identified bugs
</li></ul>
<p><br />
We recommend that all users upgrade to 1.2.2 so their board is patched against these discovered vulnerabilities and are running a more stable version of the MyBB 1.2 series.
