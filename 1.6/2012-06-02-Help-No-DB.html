MySQL error:

</pre>
<p>This means MyBB cannot connect to the database.  The database connection settings are either incorrect, or the MySQL server is down.
</p>

<ul><li> Make sure that inc/config.php exists, and the database connection settings are correct.
</li><li> Contact your webhost if the MySQL server is down (ie. if you try to login to phpMyAdmin and get the same error, then most likely the MySQL server is down).
</li></ul>
