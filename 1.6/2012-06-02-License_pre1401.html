limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business
information, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability to use

Because some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability 
for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply to you.
