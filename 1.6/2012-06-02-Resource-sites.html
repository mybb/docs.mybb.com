<p>I'm thankful to the MyBB Community for encouraging new developers and plugin coders for their software. Yaldaram.com has been started to release top class plugins for the MyBB forum software users to enhance their MyBB community. Features of plugins are unique, ideas are new and community is excellent. People from around the globe visits regularly and request their ideas for plugins. I take a quick look on their request and glad to code their requests as soon as possible. I've both Free and Paid plugins (For Free plugins you need to make a single comment on release thread) accessible without restrictions to Premium Subscribers. Subscription is cheep and you'll have some best plugins on that price. We've currently two cheap rates of subscription, Silver and Golden. There is not much we are charging for 100's of MyBB Plugins and Featured Products, and its worth off.
