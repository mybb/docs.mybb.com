<p>Each user must be part of at least one usergroup.  User Groups basically categorize users, usually by the role they have on the forum.  User Groups can also be used to give different permissions to different groups of people.

<p>There are different types of user groups. These depend on settings in the <a href="http://localhost/mediawiki/index.php?title=Admin_CP_User_Groups&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Admin CP User Groups (page does not exist)">Admin CP</a>.
</p>

<p>Default user groups are those that come with MyBB by default.
</p>
<dl><dt>Super Administrators</dt><dd> This is the usergroup for the very first user set up when MyBB was installed.  Users in this group cannot be deleted, changed or banned.  These users are also members of the "Administrators" group.  Users cannot be added to this group through the Admin CP; they must be added by changing settings in the <a href="Inc/config.php#Super_Administrators" title="Inc/config.php">inc/config.php</a> file. <b>Note:</b> This is note a <i>real</i> usergroup. It is an extension of the Administrators Usergroup.
</dd><dt>Administrators</dt><dd> This is the usergroup for the people with access to the Admin CP.
</dd><dt>Awaiting Activation</dt><dd> This usergroup is for users whose accounts have not yet been activated. Usually you won't need to manually place people into this usergroup.
</dd><dt>Banned</dt><dd> This usergroup is for people who have been banned from your board.
</dd><dt>Moderators</dt><dd> When moderators are created, they are moved to this forum if they are in the registered usergroup to start with. If you manually place users into this usergroup, they will not inherit any moderating privileges until you add them as moderator to a forum.
</dd><dt>Registered</dt><dd> This is the main usergroup for most of your users who are registered but are not part of any other usergroup.
</dd><dt>Super Moderators</dt><dd> Users in this usergroup can moderate <i>any</i> forum.
</dd><dt>Guests</dt><dd> This usergroup is used to give permissions to guests and search engine spiders.  Usually no users will appear in this usergroup.
</dd></dl>

<p>Custom user groups are any other user group that the board administrator has created.
</p>

<p>These are custom user groups that any user can join themselves (depending on the user group settings, the users' join requests may have to be moderated by a group leader or administrator first) through the <a href="{{ site.url }}/User_CP.html#Group_Memberships" title="User CP">User CP</a>.
</p>


<p>Each user must have a primary user group.  This is the main user group that will give the base permissions for the user.
</p>

<p>Each user may have multiple secondary user groups.  The permission settings in these will affect the overall permission-set for the user (see below).
</p>

<p>This usergroup is purely for setting the user group that will be shown for the user.  It does not affect permissions in any way.  For example, if a user had the Registered user group as his primary user group and the Administrators group as the display user group, he will appear as an administrator on his posts, and his username will be in the Administrator color, but he will not have any administrator permissions as he is not part of the Administrators user group.
</p>

<p>Currently in MyBB, the "yes" permission overrides any "no" permission.  This poses a problem if you explicitly want to disable a certain permission for a user group if users in that user group are in another user group with "yes" permissions for the same permission.
