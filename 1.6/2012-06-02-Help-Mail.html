<p>If you or your users are having problems with receiving mail from your server, please follow these steps before posting a support request so that we can more quickly pinpoint the problem.
</p>

<p>First please check that the mail has not been sent into the junk/spam mail folder.
</p>

<p>MyBB relies on the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php">PHP Mail function</a> to send its mail.  Thus, it is important that the PHP mail function is working.
</p><p><b>Test script:</b>
</p><p>Please create a new .php file with this content:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;?php
error_reporting(E_ALL);

$to = 'your.email@address.com';

if(mail($to, 'Testing mail', 'This is a mailing test to see if PHP mail works.'))
{
     echo 'Mail was sent by PHP';
}
else
{
     echo 'PHP could not send the mail';
}
?&gt;
</pre>
<p>Replace <b>your.email@address.com</b> with your email address.  Upload this file to your webserver and run it with your browser.
</p><p>It should say "Mail was sent by PHP" and there should not be any other errors that show up.
</p>

<p>Some webhosts have various restrictions on PHP mail.  Some hosts require that the "From" address be a mailbox address on their server.  Other hosts may disable the mail function completely.  Please ask your webhost if there are any special restrictions they have on sending mail via PHP.
</p><p>If your webhost has restricted that only mails from there own domain is allowed, try to edit the file inc/functions.php.
Look for:
</p>
<pre>mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers);</pre>
<p>and include above: ini_set("sendmail_from", " forum@<b>YOURDOMAIN</b>.com ");
<br />Then it should look like this:
</p>
<pre>ini_set(&quot;sendmail_from&quot;, &quot; forum@YOURDOMAIN.com &quot;);
mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers);</pre>
<p>YOURDOMAIN must be replaced by the domain where the forum is hosted.
</p>
