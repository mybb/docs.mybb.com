# Introduction

When using MyBB, you may encounter an Internal MyBB Error, an SQL error, or see a permissions error of some sort. These can limit what you can do with your forum, or may stop you using it altogether. This page will show you some of the common errors people encounter, along with how to fix the problem.

# Internal MyBB Errors

## MyBB Error (41)

**Error Type:** *MyBB Error (41)*

**Error Message:** Your board has not yet been installed and configured. Please do so before attempting to browse it.

**Information:** This occurs when the file `inc/config.php` is incorrectly configured. If you have not already installed your forum, you need to go to `install/index.php` and run through the installation process, including entering your database details. If you have already installed your forum, and you have data in your database, then you will need to open `inc/config.php`, use this sample `inc/config.php` text, and edit in your database information.

## MyBB Error (43)

**Error Type:** *MyBB Error (43)*

**Error Message:** The install directory (`install/`) still exists on your server and is not locked. To access MyBB please either remove this directory or create an empty file in it called `lock`.

**Information:** This occurs when your `install` folder is still present, or has not been locked. To solve this error, either completely delete the `install` folder, or create an empty file called `lock` inside the folder. MyBB requires you to remove or lock this folder so that nobody can run the installation or upgrade script and corrupt or erase your database with it.

## MySQL Error 2002

**Database:** *MySQL*

**SQL Error:** *2002 - Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock'*

**Query:** *[READ] Unable to connect to MySQL server*

**Information:** This occurs when your MySQL server is down or experiencing an issue and MyBB cannot connect to it. You will have to contact your host with this error message.

## MySQL Error 1054

**Database:** *MySQL*

**SQL Error:** *1054 - Unknown column 'loginattempts' in 'field list'*

**Query:** `SELECT loginattempts FROM mybb_users WHERE LOWER(username)='username' LIMIT 1`

**Information:** Note: this fix does not apply to all *unknown column* errors, it is specifically for the query in the image (with a different username/table prefix etc of course). Please do not suggest this fix when someone has any other *unknown column* error.

This occurs when you are using MySQL and you attempt to upgrade from 1.4.3 to 1.4.4, after you upload all the new files, but do not run the upgrade script. In 1.4.4, a new column, `loginattempts`, was added to the users table for a new security feature. The error shows as the 1.4.4 `member.php` file is trying to find the `loginattempts` column in a 1.4.3 database, where it doesn't exist. To fix this issue, go to `install/upgrade.php` and choose 1.4.2/1.4.3 from the list.

# Other Error Messages

## Error Message: *The installer is currently locked*

The installer is currently locked, please remove `lock` from the install directory to continue

**Information**: This happens when you try to run the installation or upgrade script, but your `install/` folder is locked. Simply remove the `lock` file from the `install/` folder to continue.

## Error Message: *Forbidden*

You don't have permission to access `admin/index.php` on this server.

**Information:** This is nearly always a problem with *mod_security*. *mod_security* is an Apache extension that is used for security. In MyBB 1.4, *mod_security* treats the way the URLs are set out in the ACP as a security threat, so it will deny you access.

You should contact your host provider and ask them to whitelist your domain or hosting account against *mod_security* - basically so that it doesn't affect you anymore.

## Catchable Fatal Error (4096)

This error occurs when you upgrade your forum from MyBB 1.6.4 or older to MyBB 1.6.5 or newer, or when you install a theme that was not updated properly. The *member_register* template has to be updated.

1. Go to **Admin CP > Templates > Your Theme's Template Set > Member Templates > member_register**.

2. Find:

    `{$captcha}`

3. Replace it with:

    `{$hiddencaptcha}`
