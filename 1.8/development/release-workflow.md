1. ### Source Code
   These changes can be applies during normal development in the public repository, or as patches stored in the data repository and applied to final packages by the build script.

   - #### Version Metadata
   MyBB's version and the corresponding version code (digit-only format) is hardcoded in multiple locations:
     - `MyBB::$version`, `MyBB::$version_code` (_inc/class_core.php_)

       Indicates the current version. As a result, a modified `inc/class_core.php` file is always included in the update package.
     - `$langinfo['version']` in the English language manifest (_inc/languages/english.php_)

       Indicates the latest version in which changes to language phrases occurred. If no phrases were modified, this values is left unchanged.
     - `version` attributes of `<theme>`, `<stylesheet>`, `<template>` (_install/resources/mybb_theme.xml_)

       Indicates the latest version in which changes to the default theme occurred, and in specific stylesheets and templates. If the theme was not modified, these values are left unchanged.
   - #### Update File
     Modified templates and settings should result in a `install/resources/upgrade*.php` file created for the upgrade process (no custom code is needed for synchronization of templates and settings). See [examples](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/tree/feature/install/resources).

     The file's comment is [parsed](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/cfe8257da0b017001a0f1af16f7d20f461b889ba/install/upgrade.php#L318) by the upgrade script, and should indicate which previous versions the script applies to.

1. ### Repository Maintenance
   - #### Public Repositories
     Issue and Pull Requests are reviewed to ensure that:
     - the version [Milestone](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/milestones) doesn't contain unresolved entries,
     - all Issues resolved after the previous version are assigned to the new version's Milestone,
     - correct metadata is attached to Milestone entries (i.a. closed; `s:resolved` label).

     The final public commit for the version is marked with a signed `mybb_*_build` git tag.

   - #### Internal Repositories

     Final security patches (if any) are added to the data repository on the `mybb_*_build` branch.

1. ### Pre-Release Public Testing
   The `mybb_*_build` git tag is used to provide downloadable packages of the final codebase that excludes non-public patches.

   1. A pinned [announcement thread](https://community.mybb.com/thread-219265.html) is created in the [Development forum](https://community.mybb.com/forum-165.html).

      Values copied from the internal _Getting * Ready_ thread:
      - _Comment_, basing on the `comment` value in _Additional values for version .md_ (if present; converted from Markdown to MyCode)
      - _Testing focus_ list, basing on _Public QA focus_ (if present)

   1. The link is shared and pinned in the public Discord `#18-development` channel.

   Codebase changes applied after the announcement are noted in the thread.

   The recommended minimum waiting period between the announcement and the version's final release is 7 days.

1. ### Package Building and Testing
   The [`mybb/mybb-build`](https://github.com/mybb/mybb-build) build script is used to perform tasks related to preparing releasable packages and associated information.

   1. The [`mybb/mybb-build`](https://github.com/mybb/mybb-build) repository is downloaded.
   1. Previous content of `input/patches/` is deleted (if any).
   1. The build properties in the `input/build.properties` file are configured:
     - `targetVersion`: the version number
     - `sourceRepositoryBranch`: the tag/branch in the [`mybb/mybb`](https://github.com/mybb/mybb) repository; usually `mybb_*_build`, or `mybb_*` pointing to a previous MyBB version for a security-only release
     - `inputFilesRepositoryBranch`: the branch in the data repository; usually `mybb_*_build`, or `master` if no patches are necessary
     - `includeInstallInUpdateSet`: `true` if running the upgrade script is required, `false` otherwise
     - `packageDate`: the build date (GMT+0)
   1. The build process is [run](https://github.com/mybb/mybb-build#readme).
   1. The build log is verified.
   1. The `input/` and `output/` directories are added to a `build_*_rc*.zip` archive (indicating the version code and the Release Candidate number).
   1. The created archive is signed with the Team member's public key.
   1. A post is added to the _Getting * Ready_ thread, including:
      - tags and commit hashes of repositories used during the build process:
        - [`mybb/mybb`](https://github.com/mybb/mybb)
        - the data repository
        - [`mybb/mybb-build`](https://github.com/mybb/mybb-build)
      - downloadable package and the Team member's signature
      - Release Candidate (RC) number
   1. A link to the package post is added to the _Packages_ list in the first post:
      ```
      https://... RC1 (YYYY-MM-DD 00:00)
      ```

      Links to posts with previous packages are crossed out (`[s]...[/s]`).

   1. The link to the package post is posted in the internal Discord `#staff-18-organization` channel, indicating the RC number.
   1. The packages are tested by Team members according to the _Internal QA focus_ list in the _Getting * Ready_ thread.

   The recommended minimum waiting period between the last Release Candidate is added and the version's final release is 3 days.

1. ### Announcements Preparation

   The package- and version-related information is completed and verified internally:
   - Updates to the MyBB.com website ([`mybb/mybb.com`](https://github.com/mybb/mybb.com)):
     - `_versions/*.md` [version metadata](https://github.com/mybb/mybb.com/tree/gh-pages/_versions/#versioning-metadata) for Release Notes, combined from:
       - the partial `*.md` file generated by the build script
       -  _Additional values for version .md_ from the _Getting * Ready_ thread
     - [`checksums/release_mybb_*.txt`](https://github.com/mybb/mybb.com/tree/gh-pages/checksums) checksums file, fully generated by the build script.
   - Release [Blog](https://blog.mybb.com/) Post, with:
      - the title and content generated by Jekyll basing on the version metadata at `/versions/release-blog-post/` (locally), separated by a `---` line,
      - the author set to _MyBB Team_,
      - tags _Release_, _Updates_, and _Security_ if the release addresses security-related issues.
   - Updates to the Docs.MyBB.com website ([`mybb/docs.mybb.com`](https://github.com/mybb/docs.mybb.com)):
