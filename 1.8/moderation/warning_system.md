# Warning System

The Warning System allows for lower-level moderation for various offenses and appropriate punishments to be given based on the warning level of a user.

If the Administrator chooses to allow this, a user will be able to see their warning level in their profile and UserCP and also the reason for the warning.

# Warning a User
You can warn a user from their profile, or specifically from a post (which will also be provided to the user as the cause if they are able to view warnings). To warn a user from their profile, go to the user's profile and select `Warn` next to their Warning Level. Otherwise, you can warn them from a post by selecting the `Warn` button below their post.

This brings up a page that allows you to specify further information on the warning. Administrative Notes can be specified to inform other Moderators and Administrators further about the warning, and this will not be visible to the member.

Either a predefined Warning Type can be selected (unless disabled in the AdminCP), or one set by the Administrator. Predefined warnings have their reason, point value and expiry time set already, and only require checking in the radio selection. When selecting this, their new warning level will be displayed, and also shown on a progress meter displaying their percentage of warnings in total (including the one being issued).

If you wish to notify the user of the warning via a private message check the check-box stating `Send this user a private message notifying them of this warning.` This will show a WYSIWYG editor allowing you to enter the subject and message in the editor. You also have the option to send the PM anonymously, which means that they will not know which moderator issued the warning.

The `Warn User` button will add the warning with the specified settings, and if chosen, send a private message to the user with the defined information.
