## Admin CP

Admin CP is first thing you enter when you install new software. Why? To create your forum. By new instalation you have just one forum without anything else so it is **necessary** to visit Admin CP (Control Panel) first.

But what to do when you enter it and get lost in whole bunch of functions? Here is basic guideline to start your first steps with MyBB.

##  Home

First when you enter Admin CP, you will be at index page of your Admin CP, at the "Dashboard". In this place you can see **basic informations** of your forum such as your forum version, is it updated, posts, users and else.
At that place you can also leave notes to other administrators.

At the left side you can see **Quick Access** Which will be there all the time so you can easily access any of that important points of your forum at any time.

### Preferences 

This is small page in which you can **change language** of your Admin CP if you have uploaded it. That will be useful to you if your native language is not English.

Next here you can change there theme of your Admin CP and write notes just for yourself (other administrators will not be able to see them).

## Configuration

If you are first time on forum, you will spent some time here to set it up, ready to go and publish.
Here are some most important things in that place of forum.

### Settings

If you are new and forum is not set yet, maybe you may want to close it for visitors. That can be done in **Board Online / Offline**. There you can switch if you want your forum closed for others or opened. If you choose closed, you will get message which will be displayed to visitors of your forum.

Next, you may edit some **Site Details**, for example the Board Name, URL and contact settings.

In **General Configuration** you can change the default board language as well as the CAPTCHA to use, in addition to toggling settings like friendly redirect pages and the forum jump menu

**Date and Time Formats** is almost must do if your native is not English so you will need some work there too. But before playing with that formats you may check this link to check out how they work: http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php

Next you should check **Login and Registration Options** as well as **Profile Options** in which you can choose methods of registration, some security settings and what new user need to fill in his profile and such informations.

Now it's time to check **Show Thread Options** and **Forum Display Options** to see basics about threads and posts display and function in forum.

There are more settings which you may be interested in, but for start setting this few things up is fine.

### Banning

This is place when you can ban someone from forum, or ban someone's IP and so. Please note that you can access this setting from Users & Groups -> Banning, too.

### Custom Profile Fields

There you can request some more profile fields or edit existing and request them at registration if you need it and so.

### Warning System

This is next thing you should check if you want some kind of warnings at forum. Here you can put and edit warning types and levels which moderators and adninistrators will be able to give to users for braking the rules.

### Security Questions

This point is **must** if you want some protection of spam bots. Here you can set up your security questions and answers which users should write at registration.

## Forums & Posts

Finally we are here, we can create and edit our first categories and forums here as well as set their permissions. 

In this place of forum you can add and delete categories, forums and subforums. Be extremely careful while creating them and giving permissions to users to have maximum of security and to have organised forum by categories and forums. You can easily sort them as you wish by simply putting numbers in "order" field. Forum will short it so forums and categories with lowest numbers are first and with biggest numbers are last.

## Users & Groups

When you finished with setup of forum, you have your forums and subforums and you are almost ready to go, you need some groups of moderators, administrators, who will manage your forum if you need help. Than can be done here.

### Awaiting Activation

If you require registrations to be approved by an administrator, new member registrations will appear here for you to approve.

### Groups

Here you can manage user groups, give them username colors, custom user titles and similar things for all users in same group. Also, here you can change permissions of specific group of users.

### User Titles

Here you can give some default user titles for your members

## Templates & Style

And we are here, almost ready with our forum, at last stage of putting it on track. Here you can import or edit your theme in templates or css.
Or simply upload it by clicking at **Import theme** and following steps given by theme maker.

## Tools & Maintenance

Here you can see your detailed forum informaton as well as logs what administrators and moderators did on forum, as well as other logs. They are all aviable here
