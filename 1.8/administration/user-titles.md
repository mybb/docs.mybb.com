## About User Titles

User titles is text that is displayed under the username in posts, threads, profile and on the member list.
Each group has it's own default user title which is shown if a user doesn't use a custom user title.

## How to set Default User Titles

You can set them to be default for one group or to be changed with number of posts a user has made.




#### Set User Titles According to the Group

At `Admin Control Panel -> Users & Groups -> Groups -> <usergroup name>` You can give a default user title for that group.

Just fill out the **Default User Title** field.

#### Set User Titles According the Number of Users Posts

The "Registered" group by default has this option.

If you want to use that option, leave Default User Title field in group settings blank.

You can specify the user title name, minimum number of posts, number of stars and the amount of stars at `Admin Control Panel -> Users & Groups -> User Titles`.

When adding or editing them, you have 4 options: Title to assign, Minimum amount of posts, Number of Stars, and Star image.

##### Title to Assign field

##### Minimum Posts

##### Number of Stars
